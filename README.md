## AJAX Giphy

[Giphy Quickstart Guide](https://developers.giphy.com/docs/api)

Today, you'll practice what we learned today and return a random gif from the [Giphy API](https://developers.giphy.com/explorer).

Giphy requires an API key (it's free). However, I've given you the random endpoint with a working API key in the `script.js` file.

```js
const giphyRandomEndpoint = `https://api.giphy.com/v1/gifs/random?api_key=2041494ca782403cb6055682a7943c75&tag=&rating=G`
```

Read the `script.js` file for instructions.

## Get A Random Giphy!

When I click on the `Get Random Giphy!` button I should see a random gif and the title underneath.

Make sure that you turn on GitHub Pages for your repo so we can test it out!

## Part 1

Add a 2nd button to hit the Giphy trending endpoint:

```js
const giphyTrendingEndpoint = `https://api.giphy.com/v1/gifs/trending?api_key=2041494ca782403cb6055682a7943c75&tag=&rating=G`
```

<br>

## Part 2

Add a form with an input field so that the user can `search` for gifs by keyword.

<br>

## Bonus

See if you can paginate the results
